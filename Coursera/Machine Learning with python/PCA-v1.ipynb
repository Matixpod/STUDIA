For the second application, you will use PCA to project higher dimensional data down to a lower dimensional feature space. This is an example of dimension reduction, a powerful technique that has multiple benefits, including reducing your model-building computational load and, in many cases, the accuracy of your model. PCA can help you filter out redundant, linearly correlated variables and reduce the amount of noise in your data.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d5691c96-98a3-4e5a-9627-c4d912327264","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Part I: Using PCA to project 2-D data onto its principal axes\n","Here, you will illustrate how you can use PCA to transform your 2-D data to represent it in terms of its principal axes - the projection of your data onto the two orthogonal directions that explain most of the variance in your data.
